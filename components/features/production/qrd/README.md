# QRD Form

## Multi-Page Wizard

> Below is a conceptual outline of how you might design a multi-page digital production form for your distillation/processing workflow. The goal is to capture everything from basic drum & material data, through in-process notes, to final yields, while integrating barcode scanning and real-time DB updates.

### 1. Overall Approach

1. **Multi-Page Wizard:**
   • Since you have three main sections in the paper form, create a three-page "wizard" in the app.
   • Each page focuses on one of the form sections.
   • A "progress indicator" or simple "Next/Previous" navigation helps workers move between steps.
2. **Barcode Integration:**
   • Workers scan each drum "out" of inventory before beginning the process. The system automatically associates those drums with the production run (or "batch").
   • If the system sees a drum with status = 'available', it changes that to status = 'scheduled' (or similar) to signify it's assigned to the production queue.
3. **Intermediate vs. Final Data:**
   • The form can be saved in a "draft" mode after page 1 or 2, allowing staff to come back and fill details as the distillation progresses.
   • Once the entire process is done, they submit the final page, marking the record as "complete."

### 2. Page/Section Breakdown

> Page 1: Basic Information

**Purpose**: Capture the initial job details—mirroring the top of your paper form.

Fields could include:

1. Production Record ID: auto-generated or manually assigned.
2. Material: e.g. "Methanol," "Acetonitrile," etc. Possibly a dropdown from your DB.
3. Order ID: This references the order from which the drums came. If needed, a user can confirm or select which order.
4. Drum(s) #: Possibly a list or array of drum IDs. A "Scan Drums" button can open a small scanning modal that automatically populates which drums have been assigned to this production run.
5. Date: The date the process starts.
6. Operators / "Loader" or "Transport" fields: If your form requires an operator name, loader name, or second check, you can show "Operator 1," "Operator 2," or "Transport" fields. They either type their name or select from a user list.

UI Suggestions:
• Provide a multi-drum input if scanning multiple drums at once.
• Optionally show "Scanned Drums" in a table on this page.

> Page 2: In-Process Data

**Purpose**: Mirror the middle portion of your paper form that captures transport, loader, operator checks, and possibly intermediate steps in distillation.

Fields might include:

1. Equipment fields: STILL number, MFR, etc.
2. Operator/2nd CHECK: Additional signatures or digital checkboxes to confirm readiness.
3. Mid-Process Observations: If you have times or partial volume notes, they can go here.
4. Cleaning or Setup: If the form requires specifying equipment cleaning method or "None required," these are checkboxes or small text fields.
   • E.g. "None Req," "Vented," "SOP used"
   • Possibly a "Notes" box for additional comments.

**UI Suggestions:**
• Real-time fields that can be updated during distillation. If the user can't fill it all at once, let them save and come back.
• If you require multiple intervals of data (like repeated temperature checks), you might do a small repeated "Add Row" approach.

Page 3: Final Yields and Completion

Purpose: Summarize the final production details—like how many litres were produced of each grade, the final date/times, and any sign-off.

Fields might include:

1. Output Batches: A small table for container size, no. of containers, batch no., grade, labels required, labels destroyed.
2. TOTAL Lts PRODUCED: Summation or numeric entry.
3. Equipment Cleaning: The final sign-off if cleaning was done post-distillation.
4. Times: Start Time, End Time, Start Temp, Fill Date, Completion Date.
5. Final Signatures: Operator, 2nd Check, a confirm statement "I confirm that the product and processing info is correct."

**UI Suggestions**:
• Let the user add multiple lines for multiple "container size" entries.
• The same approach for "grade/destination": if you produce multiple purity grades, they can fill multiple rows.
• Provide a "Finish & Submit" button that finalizes the record, sets the relevant DB fields (drum status becomes "processed," etc.).

### 3. Example Wizard Flow

1. User initiates a new Production Run from a "Start Production" button or from the Drums page.
2. Page 1: They fill in material name, order ID, date, scan the drums. They click "Save & Next."
3. Page 2: They see a partially completed form with operator fields, "loader," "transport," and any mid-process notes. They fill them as the shift progresses. Possibly they come back to this page throughout the day.
4. Page 3: Once distillation is finished, user inputs final yield data (e.g. container sizes, total liters, final timestamps). They click "Submit," marking the run as complete.
   • The app can then set those drums to status = 'processed'.

### 4. Data Model & DB Integration

1. Production Table (e.g. production_runs):
   • id (primary key)
   • material
   • order_id (FK to orders)
   • start_date, end_date
   • operator1, operator2
   • still_number, mfr
   • etc.
2. Production Drums (Join Table or array):
   • Linking which drums are part of this production. Could be a separate table like production_drums, with columns:
   • production_id, drum_id
   • Once a drum enters production, new_drums.status = 'scheduled'.
   • Once the run finishes, set new_drums.status = 'processed'.
3. Output Batches:
   • Possibly a production_batches table storing each container/grade row.
   • Fields: production_id, container_size, batch_no, grade, destination, labels_required, labels_destroyed, etc.

### 5. Additional Considerations

5.1. Real-Time or On-Demand?
• If you want staff to see partial data mid-run (like “we’ve produced 30 liters so far”), you can store partial volumes in the DB or hold them locally.
• SSE or WebSockets can be used if multiple operators are monitoring from different devices.

5.2. Validation & Locking
• When finalizing, ensure you have a confirm step so no accidental submission if the process isn’t truly done.
• Possibly require an operator to sign/digitally sign or provide a password for final confirmation.

5.3. Printing or PDF Export
• Since you have a paper form tradition, you might want a “Generate PDF” button that outputs the entire data in a layout similar to your original form.
• Keep the layout “approximating” the official QRD011DP doc for compliance or auditing.

### 6. Sketch of a UI

> Page 1 (Basic Info):

- Material: **\_\_\_\_**]
- Order ID: **\_\_\_**]
- Number of Drums to Process: **\_\_**]

[Scan Drums] -> This opens a modal or separate page
[Scanned Drums List]:

- 6071
- 6072
- Operators: \_\_\_
- 2nd Check: \_\_\_

---

#### Page 2 (In-Process Observations):

- Still Number: \_\_
- MFR: \_\_
- Transport: \_\_
- Loader: \_\_

- Start Temp °C: \_\_
- Equipment Cleaning: ( ) None Req ( ) Vented ( ) SOP or Comments: **\_**

[Notes or partial data fields...]
[Save & Next >]

#### Page 3 (Final Data):

#### Containers / Batches Table

##### Table Fields

- Container Size
- Number of Containers
- Batch Number
- Grade
- Destination
- Additional Fields...

#### Actions

- Add New Row

#### Summary Fields

- Total Liters Produced: **\_**

#### Timestamps

- Start Time: **\_**
- End Time: **\_**
- Fill Date: **\_**
- Completion Date: **\_**

#### Sign-off

- Operator: **\_**
- Second Check: **\_**

[Finish & Submit]

On submit, the system sets status = 'processed' for each associated drum, and the run is “complete.”

### 7. Suggestions & Next Steps

1. Keep it Simple: Some forms can be long. Minimizing required fields where possible speeds adoption.
2. Auto-Fill: If the system knows the material from the order ID, auto-populate “Material = Acetone, Supplier = X.” That saves manual typing.
3. Partial Saves: Workers might fill page 1 at the start of the day, then return to do page 2 after lunch, etc. Make sure each step is stored in the DB (or local store if short).
4. Error Handling: If a drum is scanned twice accidentally, handle it gracefully (maybe ignoring a second scan within a short time window).
5. User Training: Provide short instructions on how to navigate the wizard, scan a drum, and finalize the run.

## Conclusion

A three-page wizard for your distillation process captures all the information from your existing paper forms while integrating real-time barcode scanning. Page 1 handles basics and scanning assignment, Page 2 manages mid-process data, and Page 3 records final yields and sign-offs. By linking it to your existing DB structure (drums, orders, production runs), you ensure consistent inventory statuses (pending → available → scheduled → processed) and maintain a robust digital trail matching your official production records.

// Move to Notes app later, temp note below. Post this on ChatGPT reddit thread

Thanks for the link and the advice that's helpful. I would like to know what the popular plug-ins are that are available. Specifically once for a productivity programming, writing, that type of thing.

Incidentally, I'm trying to understand the logic of something can you help me? So I asked chatgpt itself this question that I asked you about the plug-ins. It is the first time I actually noticed the feature, and immediately was appealed by it. I wasn't sure how old the feature was, but I can see it's 2 months old from the article you linked.

Here's what ChatGPT replied to me when I asked it to explain how the "Work with [app]" feature works (and I gave a very comprehensive and detailed explanation of what I did, such as installing a "vsix" file, selecting lines of text in Cursor etc.). I even attached a screenshot to my ChatGPT message which showed clearly the "Working with Cursor" section right above the ChatGPT text input field, and I pointed it out and described what I was seeing.

I ended by asking: """So - what can you tell me about this feature? Or, what can you speculate on it at least? Do you think you're able to view my codebase? What do you "see" when I select some lines of code? Can you see the whole file for context? Those are just some basic questions, you don't have to answer each individually, just respond with your knowledge on this 'Working with VSCode' (or Cursor, etc.) feature, or at least your best guess at how it works."""

ChatGPT replied: """
I’m not directly aware of the precise mechanics behind a “Working with VSCode” feature, but here’s what I can tell you based on the general behavior of ChatGPT integrations and what you’ve described: 1. Likely a Bridge Plugin/Extension
• Most AI–IDE integrations (VS Code. Cursor extensions, etc.) rely on a plugin that selectively sends code snippets to ChatGPT (or another LLM) when you highlight text or invoke a command.
• This means ChatGPT isn’t automatically seeing your entire project—rather, you highlight or specify the lines you want to share, and then the plugin sends just that portion to ChatGPT. 2. “Focused on lines 58–91”
• That message probably indicates the plugin is telling ChatGPT: “Here’s the user’s currently selected text from lines 58 to 91.”
• ChatGPT can then give you answers specifically about that snippet.
• But typically, ChatGPT doesn’t see the entire file unless you explicitly select or copy it.
...

So here's what's confusing me about this. How is it that ChatGPT, which can now access real-time news sources, and knows the current date (unlike the older models limited to a knowledge cutoff), has no "direct knowledge" of its own update?

More confusingly, it would seem so obvious that the first thing OpenAI should do when releasing a larger update like these plugins would be to give ChatGPT the knowledge of how the update works, so it can explain it to its users/customers. Some updates aren't immediately visible or obvious or easy to use. But when your product is an LLM, you have a huge advantage in marketing your product updates to your user base: have the LLM describe it to its users! At the very least, OpenAI cuould have written a pre-generated script for ChatGPT to respond with when a user asks for info on an update. And this update - it's 2 months old! How come ChatGPT can tell me about the inauguration last week or recent stock prices, but can't tell me about its own update? This surely doesn't require extensive data and training as it's not an external data suorce, it's OpenAI's own new patch to their product. It seems almost inconceivable that they put in the effort to add this great new plugin feature, but didn't manage to do the relatively small task of writing a script for ChatGPT so it can explain to users how they can use OpenAIs new update? What am I missing?

Oh, and perhaps most ironically - you, as Microsoft CoPilot LLM, explained the update of a competitor's LLM product perfectly, yet it can't do so itself. Odd!
