-- qrd_010: Production Schedule
-- qrd_011: Individual Distillation Production Record

-- QRD_011 is a child table of QRD_010, as the schedule determines the quantity and data configuration for each production record for that day
-- These table records are "standalone" records, in that they each relate specifically to a single production record for a single day

-- The production schedule table - qrd_011, representing the QRD_010 - will contain a list of records, where each record represents a single distillation run for a single day. Initially, these contain "planned" data, which defines the expected output of the distillation runs for the many QRD_011 records that will be created for that day
-- For each day, the single production schedule record will be used to create the multiple production records that will be used to record the actual distillation data for that day (one for each still that will be used, i.e. Still A, Still B etc.)

-- Order Details of expected finihsed goods to be produced from the related distillation from a given still on any day
-- Batch number is a function of the data of production completion, still code, and the grade produced - i.e. informatin directly on the referenced pr_distillation_record (although grade, quantity is not known in advance of the completion of the distillation, so this table isn't going to be a historical record of all distillations produced. It's purpose is to hold the data on the production details in _advance_ of the distillation, so workers know what they are aiming for.

It holds the data of the order and client details, and the `pr_details` table will hold the data of the production details for each distillation.
);

-- Similar to the pr_details, but this table has the definite, non-changing data of produced batches. It will also serve as the gateway between the `production` and `inventory` schemas - though maybe the `inventory` schema for finished goods may be separate from that for raw materials.
-- The records are created as "pending" or similar, at the moment the production schedule is created and the `pr_detao;s` gets auto-updated with new records from the given schedule. This update triggers the records in `pr_batches` to be created.

Or even a lot more, if one batch will be numerous smaller orders.
